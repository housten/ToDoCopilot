# Setting up Branch Protection Rules

First we need to create our own repo from this template, clone it locally and open it in Copilot.
Make sure that copilot is installed and up and running. 

## Case : We will start adding more people to this project. How to make sure changes are good?

```prompt
Im starting to enroll more contributors on this project, so I need to be careful to review the changes. How can I enforce this on this repository?
```

We will follow the instructions of Copilot and go create branch protection rules

## Case : We see there are many settings to be set, what should we configure?

```prompt
I see that there are many rules I can set, which ones should i configure?
```

Ask for description of some of the other settings <p style="color: red;">What other settings?for branch protection or something else?</p>
```prompt
I see that there are many rules I can set, which ones should i configure?
```

## Case : We want subject matter experts to review relevant changes.
To ensure standard quality in the application, find out how to ensure that changes are reviewed by the most experienced people.

```prompt
How can I ensure subject matter experts review the relevant code in a pull request?
```

Specify a technology type to assign to a reviewer
```prompt
how do I assign my css expert to review pull requests with css changes?
```

Let's get co-pilot to suggest using teams
```prompt
The css experts might change over time, can I reference them without using specific names?
```
